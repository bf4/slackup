# slackup
backup my slacks

## Installation

`gem install slackup`

## Usage

1. Get token for each team from https://api.slack.com/web

2. Configure a file in the backup directory called `slack_teams.yml`,
though `slack_teams.yaml` and `slack_teams.json` will also work.

The config file must contain a dictionary (hash) of 
team names (backup directories) and associated tokens.

e.g.

slack_teams.yml

```yaml
---
some-team: xxxp-some-token
another-team: xxxp-different-token
```

slack_teams.json

```json
{
  "some-team": "xxxp-some-token",
  "another-team": "xxxp-different-token"
}
```

3. Run `slackup` in your terminal

Each key/value team pair will be run in a local directory named by the key
using only the token for auth. Thus, the key (team) name can be whatever you want.

## Development

This gem is does the bare basics of backup and works for me.

It has no tests.

It depends on the ['slack-api' gem](https://github.com/aki017/slack-ruby-gem)
